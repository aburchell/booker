# What 
A single web application for tracking the books that one has read, as well as for tracking one's current progress through a book.

# How
Booker uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) component library, and the [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) application built thereupon.
TODO determine backend stack.

# Why
The Year of the Word is my guiding ethos for 2021. As such, a great level of importance will be placing on reading. 
As such, it will be valuable to look back at all the books I (will have) read.

While I already keep a log of all the books and articles I read in a personal org-mode file, this interface will allow for real-time tracking of progress in books I'm currently reading,
as well as sharing my progress with friends.
In turn, they too will be able to track and share books which they are reading.
